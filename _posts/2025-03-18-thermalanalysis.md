## Foreward
This is the second (and last) paper I'll be posting here from my IB research. My opinions on the IB curriculum were well-laid out in the previous post and I'd sure be damned if anyone manages to find a valid praise for IB as a whole. Either way, some great research came out of it. I'll be posting the entire paper here so that at least some good can come out of the hours I've worked on this paper. 

## Abstract
As an aspiring computer engineer and computer scientist, I’ve been modifying and manipulating circuits and
microcontrollers in my free time. Recently, I’ve been printing out my own printable circuit board (PCB) based
on microcontrollers for hobbyist projects and a crucial part of modelling to-be-printed boards was choosing what
method allows better thermal dissipation. This is because as my model runs for longer, the temperature change will
be greater and at a point, the running temperature of the prototype will be high enough to be dangerous and could
cause third-degree burns or possibly cause combustion in components.
