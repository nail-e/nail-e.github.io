I believe that Signal is one of the better options for private communications in this day in age. Forget all the supposed offerings of end-to-end encryption by SMS/RCS, anything by Meta and the more privacy focused offerings on display like Matrix and Signal. It simply just is *better.* 

We've seen [leaked chat rooms](https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-leaks-signal-trump-classified-09f58fa650e44f740c9416c3e6997f5b), [terrorist cells](https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/dangerous-signal-this-encrypted-app-is-helping-isis-members-in-india-to-communicate/51774226) and [even anti-usage laws](https://nordicmonitor.com/2021/07/secure-messaging-app-signal-has-been-effectively-criminalised-in-turkey/) involving Signal and these aren't flaws, they're features. We should be protected in our communications. Compare that to the systematic exploitation of companies like Meta where the amount of Cambridge Analytica-esque [spying](https://apnews.com/article/technology-privacy-europe-business-european-union-2f3d73388273e8466917ffd0f09b1fd4) that permeates our daily lives for the purpose of countering the next scary threat on Meta-backed apps pales in comparison to the hands-off approach that the Signal Foundation holds around Signal. It is up to governments to secure their communications, law enforcement and supranational bodies to control terrorist cells and down to conscience to have the peace-of-mind to communicate. We need to reject the narrative that privacy is a threat and our thoughts aren't a marketable aspect of our lives - it's a human right.
